% Ray, Tai and Seow (2001) Water Resource Planning problem
% In a drainage system 3 main decision variables have been identified for
% decision making. This leads to 5 objective functions (non-linear), 
% coupled with 7 constraints due to resource limitations and water quality
% requirements.
%
% Objective Functions:  5, non-linear.
% Constraints        :  7, non-linear.
% Decision Variables :  3. 
%     0.01 <= x(1) <= 0.45
%     0.01 <= x(2) <= 0.10
%     0.01 <= x(3) <= 0.10

% References:
% The story goes like this, found this problem on [1] where is referenced to [2].
% However in [2] it is explained little and refers to [3] and [4], but in
% neither of them is extensively explained the choice of surfaces, although 
% the problem is presented in all as it is here. 
% Seems that the problem was studied in a PhD thesis at Purdue 
% by Dendrou, S. in 1978, but only found the report presented in [5].
% In [5], the whole model is discussed but not the simplifications concerning 
% creating the objective functions and more important the constraints as surfaces.
% As a matter of fact this problem can be seen as a meta-model for
% water resources planning.
