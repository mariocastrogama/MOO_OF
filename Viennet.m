% Viennet Multi-Objective function
% Input arguments
%   x  : Decision Variable Vector. Is a matrix with as many rows as
%        trial vector and as many columns as decision variables.
%   
%   f  : The objective Vector. Is a matrix with as many rows as
%        trial vectors in X and as many columns as objectives.
%
%   the X parameter domain is [-3 3]
%   number of variables is 2.  x(1), x(2)
%   number of objectives is 3. f(1) f(2) f(3)
%
% Usage:
%   x = -3+6*rand(1,2);
%   f = Viennet(x);
