function [f,cons] = MOP7(x)
% MOP7 : Multi-Objective Problem No. 7
%   The 7th function of the Van Valedhuizen's test suite.
%   all objectives other than those of MOP3 are to be MINIMIZED.
%
%   Input arguments   
%
%     x  : Decision Variable Vector. X is a matrix with as many rows as
%          trial vector and as many columns as decision variables.
%          x domain is [-400 400]
%          number of variables is 2. (x1,x2)
%
%   Output arguments
%     f  : The objective Vector. J is a matrix with as many rows as
%          trial vectors in X and as many columns as objectives.
%          number of objectives is 3. f1(x1,x2), f2(x1,x2), f3(x1,x2)
%
% Usage:
%   x = rand(5,2);
%   f = MOP7(x);
